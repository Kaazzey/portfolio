            <p class="aboutp">Gwyneth Schmitz is a UX &amp; Visual Designer in training who studies Communication &amp; Multimedia Design at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. She has previously studied to be an IT Administrator at Regiocollege in Zaandam. The technical part is cool and all, but she really wanted to explore her creativity and so she did.</p>
            <p class="aboutp">Since then she's been creating interesting and cool looking projects, for example app and website re-designs, projects with focus on user flow, customer experience and information architecture but also IoT projects and non-web/mobile app projects. Realizing them mostly in Adobe XD or Figma.</p>
            <p class="aboutp">But who is Gwyneth when she's not behind her laptop creating and styling apps or websites? She's still behind a screen, of her selfbuilt computer, to be exact, playing her favourite videogames like League of Legends, Dead by Daylight, Monster Hunter and more. If not behind her computer, then probably drawing and doodling on her iPad. And to finish, she's cat obsessed!</p>
